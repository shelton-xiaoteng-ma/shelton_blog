# About Me

Hello there! I'm Shelton, and this is my personal blog where I share my journey as a full-stack developer.

My passion lies in building and optimizing applications, and I've been immersed in the software development world since 2017. I focus on combining my expertise in full-stack development with technologies like React, Next.js, Hono, Auth.js (NextAuth.js), and ShadCN.

My extensive experience in data engineering, including the use of tools such as PySpark and AWS data lake solutions (including S3, Glue, Athena, and EMR), also provides a broader perspective and stronger technical support for my full-stack development work.

My background in reverse engineering and web scraping, working on Android app and JavaScript reverse analysis. This experience sharpened my problem-solving and code analysis skills. I also developed extensive customizations for Scrapy, enabling centralized management and granular monitoring of web scraping tasks. I'm proficient in relational databases like MySQL, non-relational databases such as Redis and MongoDB, and message queues including Kafka. I leverage these different databases and tools for scalability and data management.

My goal with this blog is to document my technical journey, share my insights, and provide valuable tips and resources for fellow developers and tech enthusiasts.

If you find my content valuable, I encourage you to subscribe to my blog, explore my posts, or join the conversation by leaving comments!

I'm thrilled to share my experiences and knowledge with you. Thank you for visiting!
