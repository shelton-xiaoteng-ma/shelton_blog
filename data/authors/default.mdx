# Problem-Solver with Expertise in Full-Stack Development and Data Analysis

I have been a programmer since 2017, specializing in full-stack development. My primary tech stack includes React, Next.js, Hono, ShadCN, and Auth.js (NextAuth.js).

Earlier in my career, I focused on reverse engineering and web scraping, working on Android app and JavaScript reverse analysis using Python and Scrapy. I also developed extensive customizations for Scrapy, enabling centralized management and granular monitoring of web scraping tasks. I also developed proficiency in relational databases like MySQL, non-relational databases such as Redis and MongoDB, and Kafka message queues. This experience sharpened my problem-solving skills, code analysis capabilities, and adaptability in learning new technologies, while providing a wealth of expertise in data collection and management.

Additionally, I have significant experience in data analysis, with expertise in PySpark and AWS data lake solutions such as S3, Glue, Athena, and EMR. These experiences have broadened my perspective and strengthened my technical foundation for full-stack development.
