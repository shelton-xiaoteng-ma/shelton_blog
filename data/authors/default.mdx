I’m a Full-Stack developer who began building for the web in 2018 and haven’t looked back since.

I specialize in developing web applications using technologies such as Next.js, Nest.js, and React.

With a strong background in web scraping and reverse engineering, I have honed my skills in data collection, source code analysis, and problem-solving.

While my primary focus is on web development, I continue to explore reverse engineering as a hobby, enriching my technical expertise and analytical abilities.
