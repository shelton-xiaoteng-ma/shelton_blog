Redux is one of the most popular libraries for state management in React applications. It helps manage the state in a predictable way, ensuring that the data flows in a consistent manner across the application. This guide will walk you through how to set up Redux in a React app.

## 1. Install Redux and React-Redux

To start using Redux, you'll need to install both `redux` and `react-redux` (which binds Redux to React components):

```shell
pnpm install redux react-redux
```

## 2. Define Your Redux Store

1. Create Action Types

    ```ts
    // actionTypes.ts
    export const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
    export const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';
    ```

2. Create Actions

    ```ts
    // actions.ts
    import { INCREMENT, DECREMENT } from './actionTypes';

    export const increment = () => ({
    type: INCREMENT,
    });

    export const decrement = () => ({
    type: DECREMENT,
    });
    ```

3. Create Reducers

    Reducers define how the state should change in response to actions. Here, we’ll have a simple reducer for the counter state:

    ```ts
    // counterReducer.ts
    import { INCREMENT, DECREMENT } from './actionTypes';

    const initialState = {
    count: 0,
    };

    export const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action: any) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case INCREMENT:
        return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
        case DECREMENT:
        return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
        return state;
    }
    };
    ```

4. Combine Reducers

    If your application has multiple reducers, you can combine them into one using combineReducers:

    ```ts
    // rootReducer.ts
    import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
    import { counterReducer } from './counterReducer';

    export const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    counter: counterReducer,
    });
    ```

## 3. Create and Configure the Store

Now, let’s create the Redux store and pass in the rootReducer:

```ts
// store.ts
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { rootReducer } from './rootReducer';

export const store = createStore(rootReducer);
```

## 4. Provide the Store to Your Application

In order to use Redux in your React components, you need to wrap your application with the Provider from react-redux. This makes the Redux store available to all components in the app.

```ts
// index.tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from './store';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## 5. Connect Redux State and Actions to Your Components

Now, let’s connect the Redux state and actions to a React component. For example, a Counter component:

```ts
// Counter.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { increment, decrement } from './actions';

export const Counter = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const count = useSelector((state: any) => state.counter.count);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

- In this component:

  - We use useSelector to access the count state from the Redux store.
  - We use useDispatch to dispatch actions when the user clicks the buttons.
