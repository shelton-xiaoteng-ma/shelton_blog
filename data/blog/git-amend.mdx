## To re-edit the latest git commit message, run

```shell
git commit --amend
```

## Re-edit an Earlier Commit

### 1. Start an Interactive Rebase(replace n with the number of commits you want to go back)

```shell
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```

### 2. Choose the commit to edit

```shell
pick abc123 First commit
pick def456 Second commit
pick ghi789 Third commit
```

Change the word pick to edit (or e) for the commit you want to re-edit:

```shell
pick abc123 First commit
edit def456 Second commit
pick ghi789 Third commit
```

### 3. Git will stop at the selected commit. To edit the commit message, run

```shell
git commit --amend
```

### 4. Continue the Rebase

```shell
git rebase --continue
```

## 3. If the Commit Has Been Pushed

```shell
git push --force
```
