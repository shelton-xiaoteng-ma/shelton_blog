## 1. Undo the Last Commit but Keep Changes in the Working Directory

If you want to undo the commit but keep the changes in your working directory (so you can edit or recommit them):

```shell
git reset --soft HEAD~1
# --soft keeps the changes staged, so the files are still ready to commit.
```

## 2. Undo the Last Commit and Unstage the Changes

If you want to undo the commit and unstage the changes (but keep the changes in the working directory):

```shell
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
```

## 3. Undo the Last Commit and Discard Changes

If you want to undo the commit and discard all the changes (irreversible):

```shell
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**Warning**: This will delete your changes permanently. Use with caution.

## 4. Undo the Last Commit in a Shared Branch (Revert)

If the commit has already been pushed to a shared branch and you donâ€™t want to rewrite history, you should create a new commit to reverse it:

```shell
git revert HEAD
```
