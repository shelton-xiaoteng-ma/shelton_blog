title: Bypass Cloudflare

draft: false
summary: More and more websites are integrating Cloudflare, standardizing anti-scraping mechanisms and enhancing reusability. Cloudflare's anti-scraping approach can generally be divided into two categories: browser environment validation via JavaScript execution and TLS/HTTP/2 fingerprint verification.

## Browser Environment Validation

### Example Website: Indeed US

- Target URL: [Indeed Jobs](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=&l=San+Antonio%2C+TX&from=searchOnHP&vjk=b40c51521578cf9a)

Using `requests` to fetch data from this URL directly will result in a `403` error with the following message:

`This website is using a security service to protect itself from online attacks. The action you just performed triggered the security solution. There are several actions that could trigger this block including submitting a certain word or phrase, a SQL command or malformed data.`

To retrieve data successfully, consider simulating a browser environment. Using [undetected chromedriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver.git) can bypass Cloudflare's checks effectively.

## TLS and HTTP/2 Fingerprint Validation

### Example Website: Marinetraffic

- Target URL: [Marinetraffic Data](https://www.marinetraffic.com/getData/get_data_json_4/z:12/X:351/Y:819/station:0)

### Observations

After Cloudflare was introduced, requests to this endpoint started returning `403` errors.

Even when providing complete cookies and headers, the requests failed. Interestingly, the same request worked in the Charles proxy tool but failed when sent via `curl` or a terminal. Packet capture comparisons revealed no significant differences.

### Solution

Use the [curl_cffi](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi) library and specify the `impersonate` parameter to simulate browser behavior, avoiding detection by Cloudflare.

```python
from curl_cffi import requests

# Use the impersonate parameter
r = requests.get("https://tools.scrapfly.io/api/fp/ja3", impersonate="chrome")

print(r.json())

# Pin a specific browser version
r = requests.get("https://tools.scrapfly.io/api/fp/ja3", impersonate="chrome124")

# Provide custom JA3/Akamai fingerprints for non-browser impersonation
# See examples directory for details.
r = requests.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", ja3=..., akamai=...)

# HTTP/SOCKS proxies are supported
proxies = {"https": "http://localhost:3128"}
r = requests.get("https://tools.scrapfly.io/api/fp/ja3", impersonate="chrome", proxies=proxies)

```
